# GameEngine
3D Game engine for UAVConcordia Swarm Project (And of course my own personal developpement, why else re-invent the wheel?)

Based on ThinMatrix's Java Game Engine tutorial on youtube.

Unfinished, because we decided to go a different route in the project.

Dependencies:
  -PyGame
  -PyOpenGL
  -Numpy
